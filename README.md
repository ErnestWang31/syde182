# Experimental vs Theoretical Study of Kinetics 
## Course project completed for SYDE182: Dynamics for the Department of Mechatronics at the University of Waterloo
### Authors: Ernest Wang, Ali Elhor, Camron Sabahi
#### The aim of the project was to process and examine experimental kinetics data and compare it against theoretical calculated data and draw conclusions. 
Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Numpy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib

An in-depth explanation with graphical visualisations on how the data was processed as well as the conclusions drawn can be found in the final report. [embed]experimentalVtheoreticalKinetics.pdf[embed]
